   This is documentation of Columbia Scuba's October 2005 trip to Cozumel that was interrupted by Hurricane Wilma.  The schedule was for October 15-22, 2005.  The trip was interruped by the hurricane and we ended up staying a little longer than expected.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Our stay was at Scuba Club Cozumel.  This is the same place Columbia Scuba has been going for several years.  They treated us wonderfully throughout the whole ordeal.

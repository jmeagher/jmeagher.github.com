    <a href="small/pa180545.jpg"><img class="thumbPic" align="right" src="thumb/pa180545.jpg"/></a>Today was a great dive day capped off by a beautiful twilight dive and a night dive.  The hurricane wasn't in our thoughts at all.  Everyone was expecting it to only affect Thursday afternoon and Friday.  The only real concern was that we may possibly not make the Saturday flight and may have to wait until Sunday to get back home.

    As the day wore on a few people were grumbling about having to be back at work for important things on Monday and were debating about trying to get an early flight out.  But preparations were beginning.  The small huts with thatch roofs had some netting added to help keep things in place.
